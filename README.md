# Distro Setup 

This is a collection of config files, and commands that I can use to setup up a new Linux distro
with my preferred setup.

## Prerequisites

Currently, this only supports the bash shell and distros that use the apt package manager.

### Installing

To install, clone this project somewhere and run the setup-distro.sh file at the top level of the project.
